## How To Use

- To add an item to the To Do List, enter a Task between 1 and 256 characters in the Task field, a valid Due Date in the Due Date field (or nothing if it has no Due Date), and (optionally) check the checkbox for if the item is already done.
- To remove an item from the To Do List, simply click the item in the Table View and then click the "remove" button.
- To edit an item in the list, simply double-click the field you'd like to edit, type the information, and press "enter". Make sure you enter valid data, or else the item won't update. (Ex: enter a valid due date, or enter "true" to mark an item as completed, or else it will be automatically marked as not done or "false")
- To clear the list of items, simply press the clear button. (Warning! Save your list beforehand or it will be lost.)
- By default, all items in the list are displayed. To display only the done items or the incomplete items, use the appropriate checkboxes that are below the Table View. They cannot both be checked. To revert to showing all of the items, simply uncheck both of them.
- To save your list, use the "save list" button. Your list will be saved as a .txt file wherever you specify in the File Chooser.
- To reload an existing list, use the "import list" button. Your list will only be imported if it originated from this application and has not been tampered with. You could theoretically write a perfect To Do List and save it as a text file, then import it to this application, but at that point you could've just made it in the application :p
- You can sort list items alphabetically, by due date, or by completion status if you click on the headers ("Task", "DueDate", or "Done?") in the Table View.
